# Nebula
Nebula is a community-driven mapping platform that goes beyond traditional navigation. 
By leveraging the power of crowdsourcing, Nebula transforms ordinary maps into dynamic, interactive, and valuable repositories of local knowledge. 
In detail, Nebula allows people with different interests to use it. The application leverages the power of the community with the same magnet so the group of people can share and engage in the specific topic. 
Our software allows users to contribute data about different points of interest, traffic updates, local events, Wi-Fi cafes, overlooked beauty places, and more. 
These contributions collectively form a dynamic, interactive map.
